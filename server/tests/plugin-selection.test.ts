/**
 * Narrowing a Bot's tools to the ones a run is about.
 *
 * Two properties are asserted harder than the rest, because they are the two that would make this
 * dangerous rather than merely wrong. The first is that a skill cannot widen anything: a declaration
 * naming a tool the Bot was never granted must produce nothing, or writing a skill — which anybody
 * signed in may do — becomes a way to grant yourself a tool. The second is the failure direction:
 * every way this can go wrong has to end with the whole catalogue offered, because a selector that
 * fails closed takes away tools an administrator granted, and does it silently.
