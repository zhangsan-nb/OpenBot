 * ONLY THE HINT THAT NARROWS IS BELIEVED, and the omission of the other one is the decision here.

 * `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint` — and warns in the same place that a client should never make
 * tool use decisions from annotations a server it does not trust supplied. That warning is the
 * whole design of this function. `destructiveHint` can only ever move an action from read to write,
 * so a server that lies with it can restrict itself and nothing else. `readOnlyHint` moves an
 * action the other way, and `classifyTool` exists to make sure nothing but review can do that.
 *
 * WHAT HONOURING `readOnlyHint` WOULD ACTUALLY BUY, which is the reason withholding it costs
 * nothing. For a curated vendor it changes no answer: an advertised name absent from the reviewed
 * `writeTools` already classifies as a read, so recording `read` for it lands on the same result by
 * a worse route. For a name the reviewed list DOES hold, `classifyTool` consults review first and
 * ignores the column, so the hint would be discarded anyway. The single case where it would change
 * an answer is a server an administrator added by URL, which has no reviewed list behind it and
 * whose every tool is a write for exactly that reason — and there, believing it means letting an
 * arbitrary server declare its own tools harmless and be believed. Zero accuracy gained, one
 * fail-open introduced, so it is not read at all.
 *
 * `destructiveHint` is taken on presence of `true` only, never inverted. The specification gives it
 * a default of true when a tool is not read-only, and applying that default would reclassify every
 * unannotated action of every MCP vendor as a write — correct by the letter and a mass revocation
 * of grants people already hold. An absent hint stays absent, which leaves the reviewed list
 * deciding exactly as it did before, and only an explicit declaration narrows anything.
 *
 * A server that sets both hints is contradicting itself, and is read as destructive. The
 * specification says `destructiveHint` is meaningless while `readOnlyHint` is true, but resolving
 * an incoherent listing towards the permissive reading is the one direction that could hurt.
