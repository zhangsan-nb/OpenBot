/**
 * Choosing which of a Bot's tools to put in front of the model, one run at a time.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A model picks the right tool reliably out of about ten. Past roughly fifteen the
 * choice starts to go wrong, and it goes wrong quietly: the model calls a plausible neighbour, or
 * calls nothing and answers from memory. A realistic deployment of this template clears fifteen on
 * the first afternoon, because Drive and Slack and Jira and the browser each bring several. So the
 * catalogue has to be narrowed before the model sees it, and the unit that does the narrowing is the
 * skill: a skill says what it is for in one line, and it says which tools it needs.
 *
 * THE NARROWING IS NOT A BOUNDARY, AND MUST NEVER BE MISTAKEN FOR ONE. What a Bot may call is the
 * grant, checked in `callTool` along with the policy and the audit row. This decides only what is
 * offered out of what was already granted. Everything here can be wrong, or skipped entirely, and no
 * Bot gains a single capability it did not already hold. That is why the failure direction below is
 * "offer everything" rather than "offer nothing": narrowing is an accuracy device, and failing it
 * closed would take away tools an administrator granted because a model call timed out.
 *
 * WHY THE MODEL CHOOSES AND NOT A RETRIEVER. A retrieval prefilter fails categorically. If the tool
 * the run needed is not in the retrieved set, no amount of model capability gets it back, and the
 * published result is that a prefilter at 99% recall can land at or below no prefilter at all for
 * exactly that reason. A model that picks the wrong skill is wrong in a way the next turn can fix.
 * A prefilter that drops the tool is wrong in a way nothing can. So the model chooses, retrieval (if
 * a deployment ever needs it) narrows into that choice rather than replacing it, and every uncertain
 * case here resolves towards offering more rather than less.
