/**
 * What this process remembers about a Bot between requests, and which run of its browser that is.
 *
 * ITS OWN MODULE BECAUSE THE RUN IS A DECISION, not bookkeeping. `index.ts` imports Playwright at
 * module scope, so anything left in there can only be tested by launching a browser, and the rules
 * below are exactly the ones with a wrong answer available: which events start a new run, and which
 * leave the one in progress alone. Same reason `browser-eviction.ts` and `profile-listing.ts` are
 * separate files. `Page` comes in as a type only, which is erased at runtime, so this module and its
 * tests stay free of the browser.
 *
 * The generation counter orders snapshots within one run of a browser and says nothing across two.
 * It is minted at zero for a session that is new, and a session is new after a container restart, a
 * redeploy, an eviction from the sweep below, and a reset. None of those reach the server, so a ref
 * it is still holding from the run before matches a row nothing has overwritten, and the boundary
 * decides about an element on a page that no longer exists.
 *
 * The run carries that difference to the server, which orders on `(run, generation)` rather than on
 * the generation alone. A Bot with its own container gets one from the container and a sandbox gets
 * one from the moment its browser last became ready; the shared computer is one process serving
 * every Bot, outliving every reset, so here the answer has to come from the session itself.
 *
 * The `Map` below is per-process state, and is allowed to be: it is one container's view of the
 * browsers it is running, not state that has to survive a replica or agree with one. A restart
 * dropping it is precisely the case the run exists for, since nothing else would say the browsers
 * were replaced.

   * counter, the run, and the control handover, and all three belong to a running browser. A Bot
   * whose browser has been closed starts a fresh session next time, which is what starting a fresh
   * browser means, and the new run is what says so.
   *
   * "Nobody watching" starts at the claim, not at the first frame. A viewer whose browser is still
   * launching holds a claim and no cast, and reading occupancy from the cast would call that Bot
   * idle for the whole cold launch: this runs on the path that adds a session, so another Bot
   * connecting then would drop the control handover out from under a screen that is seconds from
   * live. It stays occupied until teardown finishes, for the same reason at the other end.
