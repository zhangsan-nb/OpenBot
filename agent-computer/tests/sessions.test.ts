/**
 * Which run of a Bot's browser the server is looking at.
 *
 * A snapshot's generation orders snapshots within one run and says nothing across two. The counter
 * lives here, in a map this process keeps, and it restarts at one whenever the session behind it is
 * new: a container restart, an eviction from the idle sweep, or a redeploy. None of those tell the
 * server anything, so a generation the server still holds from the run before matches a row nothing
 * has overwritten, and the boundary decides about an element on a page that no longer exists.
 *
 * The run is what carries that difference. It is minted with the session and changes whenever the
 * session does, so the server can order across two of them rather than only within one.
 *
 * These test the bookkeeping rather than the browser. `index.ts` imports Playwright at module scope,
 * so a test that reached the handlers would drag a browser runtime in with it, which is the same
 * reason `browser-eviction.ts` and `profile-listing.ts` are their own modules.
