/**
 * Who owns the live screen, and what may act on it.
 *
 * A Bot has one live screen, and a second `/stream` replaces the first rather than being refused. The
 * replaced socket is not closed by that, so it stays open and closes whenever its client gets round
 * to it, which on an ordinary make-before-break reconnect is after the replacement is already
 * casting. Everything that goes wrong here goes wrong because something acted on the session's
 * viewer without establishing that it owned the one it was acting on.
 *
 * So ownership is the thing under test, and it is held per socket. A claim is taken before the
 * browser is asked for a page, which is what lets a close that lands during a cold launch be honored
 * at all: there is something to release even before there is a cast. Everything the launch produces
 * afterwards goes through that claim and is refused once it is revoked.
 *
 * The decisions rather than the stopping. Starting and stopping a cast is Playwright's job and is not
 * where the wrong answers were; `browser-eviction.ts` splits the same way and for the same reason.
 * These tests use fake casts, so nothing here needs Chrome.
